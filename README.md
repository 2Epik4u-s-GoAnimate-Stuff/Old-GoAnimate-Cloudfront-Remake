# Old GoAnimate Cloudfront Remake (https://d1t0wjmrwaukvj.cloudfront.net)
A functional recreation of an old GoAnimate Cloudfront Domain. Created for documentation purposes. Differences to the domain usually used in Wrapper can vary from different encryption, to full changes in the themes.
## Setup
Simply host/localhost the files. Use with Wrapper Offline can be achived simply by pasting the contents of this repo into the server folder, and changing the Wrapper Config accordingly.
